# Digit-Recognizer-with-KNN

In this example, I will use the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to sort data. KNN is a machine learning method that relies on proximity between data to make predictions or classifications.

The Digit Recognizer dataframe is a dataset widely used in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It consists of a collection of handwritten digit images, where each image is represented as a matrix of pixels. Each pixel contains a value that indicates the gray intensity corresponding to that point in the image.
